/* String -> String Map data structure optimized for size.
 * This file implements a data structure mapping strings to other strings
 * implementing an O(n) lookup data structure designed to be very memory
 * efficient.
 *
 * The Redis Hash type uses this data structure for hashes composed of a small
 * number of elements, to switch to an hash table once a given number of
 * elements is reached.
 *
 * Given that many times Redis Hashes are used to represent objects composed
 * of few fields, this is a very big win in terms of used memory.

/* Memory layout of a zipmap, for the map "foo" => "bar", "hello" => "world":
 *
 * <status><len>"foo"<len><free>"bar"<len>"hello"<len><free>"world"
 *
 * <status> is 1 byte status. Currently only 1 bit is used: if the least
 * significant bit is set, it means the zipmap needs to be defragmented.
 *
 * <len> is the length of the following string (key or value).
 * <len> lengths are encoded in a single value or in a 5 bytes value.
 * If the first byte value (as an unsigned 8 bit value) is between 0 and
 * 252, it's a single-byte length. If it is 253 then a four bytes unsigned
 * integer follows (in the host byte ordering). A value fo 255 is used to
 * signal the end of the hash. The special value 254 is used to mark
 * empty space that can be used to add new key/value pairs.
 *
 * <free> is the number of free unused bytes
 * after the string, resulting from modification of values associated to a
 * key (for instance if "foo" is set to "bar', and later "foo" will be se to
 * "hi", I'll have a free byte to use if the value will enlarge again later,
 * or even in order to add a key/value pair if it fits.
 *
 * <free> is always an unsigned 8 bit number, because if after an
 * update operation there are more than a few free bytes, they'll be converted
 * into empty space prefixed by the special value 254.
 *
 * The most compact representation of the above two elements hash is actually:
 *
 * "\x00\x03foo\x03\x00bar\x05hello\x05\x00world\xff"
 *
 * Empty space is marked using a 254 bytes + a <len> (coded as already
 * specified). The length includes the 254 bytes in the count and the
 * space taken by the <len> field. So for instance removing the "foo" key
 * from the zipmap above will lead to the following representation:
 *
 * "\x00\xfd\x10........\x05hello\x05\x00world\xff"
 *
 * Note that because empty space, keys, values, are all prefixed length
 * "objects", the lookup will take O(N) where N is the numeber of elements
 * in the zipmap and *not* the number of bytes needed to represent the zipmap.
 * This lowers the constant times considerably.
